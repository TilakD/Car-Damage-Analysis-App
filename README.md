# Car Damage Detective

### Assessing Car Damage with Convolutional Neural Networks

A proof of concept to use computer vision and deep learning to check whether a car is damaged or not and if damaged check severity and location. 
Trained a pipeline of convolutional neural networks using transfer learning on DenseNet-201 with Keras and Tensorflow to classify damage. 
Deployment is done using a web app with Flask, dockers and tensorflow serving.
